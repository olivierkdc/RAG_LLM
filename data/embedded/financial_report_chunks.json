You should read the following MD&A in conjunction with our 2024 Annual Report and our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 included in Financial Statements. INTRODUCTION Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970, with a mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market.",
    "We do this primarily by purchasing single-family and multifamily residential mortgage loans originated by lenders. In most instances, we package these loans into guaranteed mortgage-related securities, which are sold in the global capital markets, and transfer interest-rate and liquidity risks to third-party investors. In addition, we transfer a portion of our mortgage credit risk exposure to third-party investors through our credit risk transfer programs, which include securities- and insurance-based offerings.",
    "We also invest in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities, and other types of assets. We do not originate mortgage loans or lend money directly to mortgage borrowers. We support the U.S. housing market and the overall economy by enabling America's families to access mortgage loan funding with better terms and by providing consistent liquidity to the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets. We have helped many distressed borrowers keep their homes or avoid foreclosure and have helped many distressed renters avoid eviction.",
    "Since September 2008, we have been operating in conservatorship, with FHFA as our Conservator. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our management, business activities, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future is uncertain, and the conservatorship has no specified termination date. We do not know what changes may occur to our business model during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. In connection with our entry into conservatorship, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Treasury under which we issued Treasury both senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock.",
    "The Purchase Agreement with Treasury is critical to keeping us solvent and avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory receivership provisions. We believe the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to have adequate liquidity to conduct normal business activities. For additional information on the conservatorship and related matters and the Purchase Agreement, see our 2024 Annual Report. The Administration has made comments regarding a number of potential transactions involving us and Fannie Mae, including a public offering of our equity securities while in conservatorship or outside of conservatorship, and the potential for our exit from conservatorship.",

While we continue to monitor regulatory and policy developments, we cannot predict the accuracy, timing, or impact of such statements or any related policy actions. Freddie Mac 3Q 2025 Form 10-Q 1 Management's Discussion and Analysis Introduction Business Results Consolidated Financial Results Net Revenues and Net Income (In billions) 46 Net Worth (In billions) 156 Key Drivers: n Net income was $2.8 billion, down 11% from 3Q 2024, primarily driven by a credit reserve build in 3Q 2025, compared to a credit reserve release in 3Q 2024. n Net revenues were $5.7 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower non-interest income, partially offset by higher net interest income.",
    "n Net worth was $67.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, up from $56.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. The quarterly increases in net worth have been, or will be, added to the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. The liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock was $137.5 billion on September 30, 2025, and will increase to $140.2 billion on December 31, 2025 based on the increase in net worth in 3Q 2025. Market Liquidity Market Liquidity (In thousands) 36 We support the U.S. housing market by executing our mission to provide liquidity and help maintain credit availability for new and refinanced single-family mortgages as well as for rental housing.",
    "We provided $124 billion in liquidity to the mortgage market in 3Q 2025, which enabled the financing of 483,000 home purchases, refinancings, and rental units.

Market Risk Overview Our business segments have embedded exposure to market risk, which is the economic risk associated with adverse changes in interest rates, volatility, and spreads.",
    "Market risk can adversely affect future cash flows, or economic value, as well as earnings and net worth. The primary sources of interest-rate risk are from our investments in mortgage-related assets, non-mortgage assets (including U.S. Treasury securities), the debt we issue to fund these assets, and our Single-Family guarantees. Interest-Rate Risk Our primary interest-rate risk measures are duration gap and Portfolio Value Sensitivity (PVS). Duration gap measures the difference in price sensitivity to interest rate changes between our financial assets and liabilities and is expressed in months relative to the value of assets.",
    "PVS is an estimate of the change in the present value of the cash flows of our financial assets Freddie Mac 3Q 2025 Form 10-Q 29 Management's Discussion and Analysis Risk Management and liabilities from an instantaneous shock to interest rates, assuming spreads are held constant and no rebalancing actions are undertaken. PVS is measured in two ways, one measuring the estimated sensitivity of our portfolio's value to a 50 bps parallel movement in interest rates (PVS-L) and the other to a nonparallel movement (PVS-YC), resulting from a 25 bps change in slope of the yield curve.",
    "While we believe that duration gap and PVS are useful risk management tools, they should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements. Prior to 1Q 2025, our interest-rate risk limits required asset duration to match liability duration, net of derivatives. When capital increased, excess net assets were invested in investments with little to no duration, such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements, increasing our earnings sensitivity to short-term interest rates. Beginning in 1Q 2025, we updated our interest-rate risk limits to allow for longer-term investments, reducing our earnings sensitivity to changes in short-term interest rates.",
    "We continue to manage interest-rate risk related to financial instruments primarily funded by debt as before, targeting a low level of interest rate exposure as measured by our models. For all other financial instruments, we manage interest-rate risk to a target duration, which reduces our long-term earnings volatility related to changes in overnight rates. Such financial instruments may include U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-related securities, repurchase agreements, and derivatives. The tables below provide our duration gap, estimated point-in-time, and minimum and maximum PVS-L and PVS-YC results, and an average of the daily values and standard deviation.",

RISK FACTORS This Form 10-Q should be read together with the Risk Factors section in our 2024 Annual Report, which describes various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject.",
    "These risks and uncertainties could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and/or prospects. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities The securities we issue are \"exempted securities\" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result, we do not file registration statements with the SEC with respect to offerings of our securities. Following our entry into conservatorship, we suspended the operation of, and ceased making grants under, equity compensation plans.",
    "Previously, we had provided equity compensation under those plans to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Under the Purchase Agreement, we cannot issue any new options, rights to purchase, participations, or other equity interests without Treasury's prior approval. Information About Certain Securities Issuances by Freddie Mac We make available, free of charge through our website at www.freddiemac.com/investors, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all other SEC reports and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with the SEC.",
    "The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding companies that file electronically with the SEC. We provide information on the ERCF on our website at www.freddiemac.com/investors. We provide disclosure about our debt securities on our website at www.freddiemac.com/debt. From this address, investors can access the offering circular and issuance information for debt securities offerings under Freddie Mac's global debt facility, Freddie Mac 3Q 2025 Form 10-Q 92 Other Information including any required pricing supplements for individual issuances of debt securities.",
    "Similar information about our STACR transactions and MSCR transactions is available at crt.freddiemac.com and mf.freddiemac.com/investors, respectively. We provide disclosure about our mortgage-related securities, some of which are off-balance sheet obligations (e.g., K Certificates), on our website at www.freddiemac.com/mbs and mf.freddiemac.com/investors. From these addresses, investors can access information and documents, including offering circulars and offering circular supplements, for mortgage-related securities offerings.",
    "We provide additional information, including product descriptions, investor presentations, securities issuance calendars, transaction volumes and details, redemption notices, Freddie Mac research, and material developments or other events that may be important to investors, in each case as applicable, on the websites for our business divisions, which can be found at sf.freddiemac.com, mf.freddiemac.com, and capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/capital-markets. OTHER INFORMATION Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies No executive officer or director adopted or terminated any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of, or any other such trading arrangement for, our securities during 3Q 2025.",
    "For additional information on executive officer and director compensation and security ownership by our executive officers and directors, see Directors, Corporate Governance, and Executive Officers, Executive Compensation, and Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters in our 2024 Annual Report. EXHIBITS The exhibits are listed in the Exhibit Index of this Form 10-Q. Freddie Mac 3Q 2025 Form 10-Q 93 Controls and Procedures Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including the company's Interim CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.",
    "In designing our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in implementing possible controls and procedures. Management, including the company's Interim CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2025. As a result of management's evaluation, our Interim CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2025, at a reasonable level of assurance, because we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information known by FHFA on an ongoing basis is communicated from FHFA to Freddie Mac's management in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding our required disclosure under the federal securities laws.",
    "We consider this situation to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Given the inherent nature of this ongoing weakness, we believe it is unlikely that we will be able to remediate this material weakness while under conservatorship. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING 3Q 2025 We evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 3Q 2025 and concluded that there were no changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
    "MITIGATING ACTIONS RELATED TO THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING As described above under Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures, we have one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025 that we have not remediated. Given the structural nature of this material weakness, we believe it is likely that we will not remediate it while we are under conservatorship. However, both we and FHFA have continued to engage in activities and employ procedures and practices intended to permit accumulation and communication to management of information needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws.",
    "These include the following: n FHFA has established a process to facilitate operation of the company under the oversight of the Conservator. n We provide drafts of our SEC filings to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to filing. We also provide drafts of certain external press releases and statements to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to release. n FHFA personnel, including senior officials, review our SEC filings prior to filing, including this Form 10-Q, and engage in discussions with us regarding issues associated with the information contained in those filings.",
    "Prior to filing this Form 10-Q, FHFA provided us with a written acknowledgment that it had reviewed the Form 10-Q, was not aware of any material misstatements or omissions in the Form 10-Q, and had no objection to our filing the Form 10-Q. n Our senior management meets regularly with senior leadership at FHFA, including, but not limited to, the Director. n FHFA representatives attend meetings frequently with various groups within the company to enhance the flow of information and to provide oversight on a variety of matters, including accounting, credit and capital markets management, external communications, and legal matters.",
    "n Senior officials within FHFA's accounting group meet frequently with our senior financial executives regarding our accounting policies, practices, and procedures. Freddie Mac 3Q 2025 Form 10-Q 94 Controls and Procedures Although we and FHFA have attempted to design and implement disclosure policies and procedures to account for the conservatorship and accomplish the same objectives as disclosure controls and procedures for a typical reporting company, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, test, or operate effective disclosure controls and procedures under the circumstances of conservatorship.",
    "Despite our material weakness, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements for 3Q 2025 have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.
